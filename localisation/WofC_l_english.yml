 wc.1.d:0 "Hello and thank you for playing my mod. Now, I want to tell you about few changes, that I made. \nTHE FIRST ONE: All of the world is Animist, but you can found a religion. Get 100 overall development and choose Religious Ideas and the event will popup. But know this, there's not so much religions to found. \nSECOND ONE: Propogation of Religion is now allowed for all Religions and will have less harsh conditions for fiting this event. \nTHIRD ONE: Trade Company areas are gone, but they are replaced by colonies, which should give you the same profit, but also, it's more interesting. \nNow, about the mod itself, this is Civilization World mod, that brings nations from Civilization 5 and 6 games. Every nations starts in it's True Start Location (But you can randomize locations if you want some spice), with Imoortal Leader and 2 colonists. I highly suggest you to learn your location and possibilities, that players (if in MP) and AI could do. \nThank you for your attention and happy games!"
